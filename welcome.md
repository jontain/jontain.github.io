i threw the line into the water

but after ten minutes there was no reward.

"mommy what's the fun of this?

it's purely selfish."

I am ambiguous

but your eyes tell me that you understand

so I laugh in relief

that somebody finally sees me

in the true colors that I have painted of

myself

Window to 


I am a creature of expression

for myself only

but i yearn for the wandering eyes

that only glimpse at the light

but the darkness hides the goodness

that only the truth will show

its irony isn’t it

knowing that you don’t know

only 

I

oh look at my creativity

does it mask my shallow vanity

for it rhymes just as much as it lies

but i am not a cliche

i am not a rouse

i am simply just a drop

in this lighting fuse




You are not special!


if you say it loud

you’ll break the silence

because it roared in your head

oh sure they’ll listen

go stir up a crowd!

they’ll nod their heads in agreement

i want to cross the border

to know what its like

to be on the other side

where things can’t be lost in translation

so you can fully empathize

my ways and my thoughts

as selfishly as i impose them
